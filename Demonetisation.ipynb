    "# Exploratory Data Analysis of ~20k tweets from 9/11/2016 to 12/12/2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Today Demonetisation is something that has affected every single person in the country, in a mostly direct way. Though are no official stats on the impact it had on the economy in the last 40 days or so I thought it would be interesting to explore the general sentiment on Twitter, to understand what folks from diverse walks of life think.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  It was easier said than done. Depending on the way you see it, Twitter data is either entirely usesless or is very difficult to classify. Though I certainly dont think Twitter as the gold standard of the country's opinion, I still valid  opinions are voiced there and it's worth taking a look. \n",
    "  \n",
    " I compiled close to 20,000 tweets, from 9/11/2016 to 12/12/2016, classified sentiments using Indico.io's sentiment classifier and also hand classified a few tweets written in Hinglish.\n",
    " \n",
    " These were the questions I was trying to get answered with these tweets:\n",
    " * What was the average sentiment over these 34 days. \n",
    " * How did sentiments change over a period of time in India's top 10 cities by population. What were folks outside india saying and how did that change over time?\n",
    " * Where did the most positive tweets come from? Where did the most negative tweets come from?\n",
    " * What were Twitter's \"influencers\" saying about this move? And how did that change over time?\n",
    " * \n"
